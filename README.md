# Essy
Essy is a simple proxy server that runs [Groovy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groovy_(programming_language)) script attached to request so a client is able to do anything it wants with request and its response.

A few things you can do with Essy:
* Modify content of request or response as byte array, plain string or even JSON;
* Modify request/response headers;
* Compress/decompress request/response with gzip;
* Simulate delays and timeouts;
* Measure content length and calculate any statistics.
